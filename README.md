This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Discord webhook sender.
Although the repository contains only one example, the same base code can be easily modified to send a wide range of different webhook messages by adjusting the payload.

For example, I created a channel called "twitter" on my personal Discord server, where different users automatically "tweet" throughout the day using scheduled timers.
